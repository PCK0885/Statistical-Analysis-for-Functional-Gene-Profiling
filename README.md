# Statistical-Analysis-for-Functional-Gene-Profiling
Multi-metric statistical assessment to identify genes that are significantly associated with prion strain-dependent infection or replication upon gene loss-of-function. The approach integrates intra-gene correlation analyses, effect size estimation, classical significance testing, and non-parametric significance evaluation via permutation testing.
